==============

sphinx-autorun is an extension for Sphinx_ that can execute the code from a
runblock directive and attach the output of the execution to the document. 

.. _Sphinx: https://sphinx.readthedocs.io/

For example::

    .. runblock:: pycon
        
        >>> for i in range(5):
        ...    print i

Produces::

    >>> for i in range(5):
    ...    print i
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5


Another example::

    .. runblock:: console

        $ date

Produces::

    $ date 
    Thu  4 Mar 2010 22:56:49 EST

Currently autorun supports ``pycon`` and ``console`` languages. It's also
possible to configure autorun (from `conf.py`) to run other languages.

About this fork
---------------

sphinx-contrib/autorun was abandoned and broken for several months. Since it
did not even work, this fork was created as a continuation of it with mostly
critical fixes.
